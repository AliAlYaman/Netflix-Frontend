# Netflix-Frontend

This project is the frontend component of a Netflix clone, built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Axios. It features AI-powered movie recommendations, enhancing the user experience with personalized suggestions.

## Features üöÄ

* **React.js:** Built using the powerful React.js library for a dynamic and interactive user interface.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and a consistent design.
* **Axios:** Uses Axios for efficient HTTP requests to the backend API.
* **AI-Powered Movie Recommendations:** Implements an AI recommendation system to suggest movies based on user preferences and viewing history. This is done by sending movie information to a backend AI service which then returns a list of recommended movies.
    * Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) or other machine learning techniques for enhanced recommendation accuracy.
    * Provides personalized suggestions, improving user engagement.
* **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Dynamic Movie Browsing:** Displays movies in categories (e.g., Trending, Top Rated, Action) for easy navigation.
* **Search Functionality:** Enables users to search for movies with relevant suggestions.
* **User Authentication:** Includes login, signup, and user profile management.
* **Video Player Integration:** Features an integrated video player for smooth streaming.

## Technologies Used üíª

* **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
* **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## AI Recommendation Implementation üß†

The AI recommendation system is implemented by:

1.  Sending user viewing history and/or movie metadata (title, description, genre) to the backend AI recommendation API.
2.  The backend API processes this data using NLP or other machine learning techniques.
3.  The API returns a list of recommended movie IDs.
4.  The frontend fetches the movie details based on the returned IDs and displays them to the user.

## Future Enhancements üîÆ

* Implement more advanced AI recommendation algorithms.
* Add user review and rating functionality.
* Improve search functionality with advanced filtering options.
* Add download functionality.
* Optimize video player performance.
